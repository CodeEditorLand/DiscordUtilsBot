# Biome Discord Utils Bot

Util bot for the Biome Discord server. [WIP]

## Deploying

Make sure you run the `deploy-commands` script before deploying! It updates the command list on Discord.

It needs a `.env` file at the root of the project, with `APPLICATION_ID` and `DISCORD_TOKEN` variables.

When you're done running the script, go ahead and run `pnpm run deploy` to instantly deploy your changes to Cloudflare.
